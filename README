NOTES

Subroutines starting with an underscore character (e.g. sub _foo {}) are
considered private.  They are still sorted but put after non-private

If you do not wish a subroutine sorted (moved) place the '# no subsort'
anywhere in the code block to preserve the current location order: E.g.

sub foo { # no subsort
